	<h1>The Jobseeker’s Guide</h1>
	
	<p class="about-info">
		There are a variety of aspects of the job search a job seeker just doesn’t have any control over. Even with the great amount of effort you put forth, there’s no guarantee your experience level will impress your potential employer or you’ll make it past a phone interview.<br>
		But there is one part of the job search you do have complete control over — your attitude — and it’s arguably the most important piece of your job search.<br>
		The job search can do a significant amount of wear and tear to your mental outlook. The mixed range of emotions that job seekers experience on a daily basis can sometimes stretch from frustration to an overall lack of lack of confidence — neither of which lend themselves to any sense of positivity.<br>
		While it’s no simple feat to overcome the negativity you’re faced with, there are many reasons why upholding a positive attitude allows you to remain powerful and resilient in the face of common struggles during your job search.<br>
		Aside from simply pushing you forward when you’re feeling worn down, your positive attitude can be used as leverage to help you stand out from the competition–you’ll be able to accept criticism and handle rejection better, and it will even help you search harder and potentially help you secure a job faster.

	<i>List of Information You Need to Apply for a Job</i><br>
	An <b>application</b> form is designed to bring out the essential information and personal qualities that the employer requires and does not allow you to gloss over your weaker points as a CV does. In addition, the time needed to fill out these forms is seen as a reflection of your commitment to the career.
	When you complete a job application, regardless of whether it is a paper application or an online job application, there is information you will need to provide in order to complete the job application and submit your application for employment.<br><br>
	In addition, to providing personal information, work history, education, qualifications and skills, you will also be asked to attest to the fact that all the information you are giving is accurate.<br><br>
	Not telling the truth, fudging employment dates, leaving out information, and other inaccuracies can be grounds for not being hired or for being terminated in the future if the company finds out you misrepresented your background or lied on the job application.

	<div class="main-title">How to prepare for a job interview?</div>
	<div class="about-info">
	3 Categories for Preparation of Interview
	<ul>
		<br><li>Physical preparations for interview.</li>
		Physical preparations include looking after health and hygiene, maintaining a groomed appearance, dressing appropriately, good body language, etc.<br>
		Good health radiates confidence and cheer. A healthy person not only looks attractive but he /she is more energetic and fit to face the challenges of a tough situation. A clean, neat and tidy appearance also sends out positive vibes. In any competitive situation, a person with a neat appearance is likely to score over another competitor who has an untidy and disheveled appearance. Well maintained skin-texture, neatly-clipped nails and neatly combed hair can go a long way to create a good impression.
		<br>
		
		<br><li>Mental preparations for interview.</li>
		Candidates who desire to get selected in the face of stiff competition need to appear before the interview panel fully prepared on subject content. This includes a thorough revision of actual subject knowledge especially if it is work related. Getting acquainted with current affairs and general knowledge is also a good idea. Usually selection interviews begin with the candidate being asked to introduce and tell the panel something about him/ her. This is the time when the interviewee can utilize to the maximum and project an optimum image of him/her. Since this question is invariably asked at any and every interview, one should give a lot of time and take a lot of care while preparing this part.
		<br>
		
		<br><li>Psychological preparations for interview</li>
		An interview for a job becomes a situation with much at stake and is bound to be stressful. At such times, a strong, balanced, positive and confident mind helps to come out calmly, without much damage to self-esteem. It is imperative to remember during this time that it is not a matter of life and death to get selected in any one particular interview. Each interview should be taken as a learning process in order to do better in the next one. Learning from the experiences of the last interview, one can prepare better for the ones to come.

	<div id="go_interview1" class="main-title">Interview tips</div>
	<div class="about-info">
	<b>What do I need to do before an interview ?</b><br>
	Give yourself plenty of time to :
	<ul>
		<li>research the role and the organization;</li>
		<li>think about how well your experience, interests and skills fit the job and the organization;</li>
		<li>find out what the prospective employer is actually looking for;</li>
		<li>anticipate questions you might be asked, then prepare answers to these questions;</li>
		<li>Find out what form the interview will take, e.g. single, panel, group etc.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	You should also :
	<ul>
		<li>Plan the day of the interview, especially your journey with an aim to arrive ten minutes early. Take money in case you need to take a taxi or bus unexpectedly; carry an A-Z street map or put the postcode of the organization into Google maps on your mobile to prevent getting lost</li>
		<li>Decide what you will wear and set it out the night before. Suits and business wear are the best option with comfortable, polished shoes;</li>
		<li>Get an early night - we all perform better when fully awake.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<b>How do I make a good impression at a job interview ?</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Arrive on time or better still early;</li>
		<li>Be organized. Take your application letter, CV and examples of work (if appropriate) with you;</li>
		<li>Listen carefully to questions and answer them concisely;</li>
		<li>Highlight your best attributes in the interview. Before you go, think about what you want the interviewer to know about you (in relation to the job) during the interviewing process;</li>
		<li>Pay attention to the way you communicate. There's evidence to suggest that non-verbal communication overpowers verbal communication so if you describe yourself as confident and outgoing but speak inaudibly and avoid eye contact, the interviewer will read the latter as indicating a lack of confidence and disregard what you said about being confident;</li>
		<li>Practice anything you're concerned about. This could be saying your answers aloud, which builds confidence in hearing yourself speak, or having a trial run of the journey to the interview.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<b>What should I take to a job interview ?</b>
	<ul>
		<li>In general you will not need more than your own letter of application and CV, the job specification/description and your own notes.</li>
		<li>Your invitation to interview should detail everything you need to bring. Often employers request examination certificates, which can take time to locate, so make sure you check what you need in plenty of time.</li>
		<li>You might wish to impress by reading up on the organization’s literature, e.g. a business plan or corporate social responsibility strategy, but make sure you have read it in depth and be prepared to share your views and ideas.</li>
		<li>A pen and notebook are always worth carrying with you and, if giving a presentation, take a copy on a data stick even if you have emailed it beforehand, along with copies of the slides to use as handouts for the interview panel.</li>
		<li>If you take a mobile phone, make sure it is switched to silent or off before entering the organization</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div class="main-title">Types of Interviews</div>
	<div class="about-info">
	It's important to be aware of the various types of job interviews, so you're prepared to effectively interview. Here are all the details on <b>Individual interview, Phone and Video interviews.</b>
	<br><br><b>Individual interviews</b><br>
	Even though you're probably going to be really nervous when you go on your first job interview, the key to a successful first interview is to prepare for the interview, practice interviewing, dress appropriately and try to stay calm.
	<br>Remember, your interviewer is mostly likely used to interviewing first time job seekers. Plus, everyone has a first interview in their work history. After interviewing the first time, it will get much easier. Since you don't know exactly what situations you will be asked about if it's a behavioral interview, refresh your memory and consider some special situations you have dealt with or projects you have worked on. You may be able to use them to help frame responses.
	
	<br><br>
	<b>Phone interviews</b>
	<br>
	Employers use telephone interviews as a way of identifying and recruiting candidates for employment. Phone interviews are often used to screen candidates in order to narrow the pool of applicants who will be invited for in-person interviews. They are also used as a way to minimize the expenses involved in interviewing out-of-town candidates.<br>
	While you're actively job searching, it's important to be prepared for a phone interview on a moment's notice. You never know when a recruiter or a networking contact might call and ask if you have a few minutes to talk.
	
	<br>
	<b>During the Phone Interview</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Don't smoke, chew gum, eat, or drink.</li>
		<li>Do keep a glass of water handy, in case you need to wet your mouth.</li>
		<li>Smile. Smiling will project a positive image to the listener and will change the tone of your voice.</li>
		<li>Speak slowly and enunciate clearly.</li>
		<li>Use the person's title (Mr. or Ms. and their last name.) Only use a first name if they ask you to.</li>
		<li>Don't interrupt the interviewer.</li>
		<li>Take your time - it's perfectly acceptable to take a moment or two to collect your thoughts.</li>
		<li>Give short answers.</li>
		<li>Remember your goal is to set up a face-to-face interview. After you thank the interviewer ask if it would be possible to meet in person.</li>
	<ul>
	<br>
	
	<b>Video interviews</b>
	<br>
	The use of video interviewing is growing. It started with high tech companies, but diverse employers are increasingly aware of the benefits of web based video interviewing. There is consistency - all candidates are asked the same set of questions. Questions can be specifically tailored for the job the employer is hiring for. Hiring managers have the opportunity to replay, review, and rate the interviews online, so they can compare candidates without having to remember who said what or review their notes.<br>
	After hiring managers review the video interviews, they can select certain candidates for managers to review. Again, the manager can see each candidate answering the same questions, and can compare the responses. For the employer, video interviewing can save time and hiring expenses, because there are reduced travel costs and management time.<br><br>
